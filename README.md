# Covid-Prediction-Application-using-CNN

Detection of Covid-19 disease through X-ray results can be automated using Machine Learning. This application is an example of the application of Supervised Learning, namely Classification. Classification method used is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In making a covid prediction model, preprocessing is carried out first, which will then be followed by a training process. After being trained, the accuracy of the model will be measured using data validation. After that, the application can be tested using test data.
The application can predict the results of the lung X-ray that you want to predict with the Covid or Normal criteria. The libraries used to create the CNN model are Tensorflow and Keras.
